				<h2>I will definitely book again in the future.</h2>
				<p>“This location is very stylish and modernly furnished. It comes equipped with everything you need for a comfortable stay and it truly feels like a home away from home. It sits in a new but quiet neighborhood just minutes away from the city’s main attractions. The hosts offered great communication, especially for a first timer like me. I will definitely book again in the future.”</p>

				<h2>I highly recommend this home to anyone visiting this area.</h2>
				<p>“We stayed at Michael’s home for a lacrosse tournament at the DE Turf sports complex. It could not have been better. The townhome was so clean and so comfortable and was incredibly convenient to food and to the complex. Michael was such an accommodating host and when our plans changed and I had questions, he was quick to respond and help. ...Thank you Michael for a great stay, we will be back for sure! I highly recommend this home to anyone visiting this area, you will not be disappointed.”</p>
